<p>A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, entertainment or as an act of
    compassion such as taking in and protecting a stray cat, rather than as a working animal, livestock or laboratory
    animal. ... Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats.</p>

<h4>Dogs</h4>
<p>The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered
    a distinct species)[5] is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids,[6] and is
    the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.[7][8][9][10][11] The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister
    taxa[12][13][14] as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,[13][14] which
    implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.[15] The dog was the first animal to be domesticated,[14][16]
    and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical
    attributes.[17]</p>

<h4>Cats</h4>
<p>The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae
    and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family.[4] The cat is either a
    house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by
    humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
    registries.[6]</p>
